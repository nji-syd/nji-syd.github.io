      <description>Last Monday marked the start of the latest series of Fast.ai courses: Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders. If you have an interest in data science and havenâ€™t heard of Fast.ai, you should check them out. Fast.ai is a community started by Jeremy Howard and Rachael Thomas in 2016. It now includes an impressive set of courses and a machine learning library by the same name. What sets them apart is their practical no nonsense approach to solving data science problems by example.</description>

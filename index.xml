      <description>Quantifying uncertainty is a fundamental and challenging task in financial modelling. In this post we’ll look at the bootstrap technique and how it can be applied to quantitative models. More generally, the bootstrap lies at the heart of a statistical technique called Bootstap Aggregation (bagging for short), which is the basis for machine learning algorithms such as random forest.
The Bootstrap As an undergraduate I found statistics a grind, obscured by a deluge of mathematical formulas and jargon.</description>

      <description>Last Monday marked the start of the latest series of Fast.ai courses: Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders. If you have an interest in data science and haven’t heard of Fast.ai, you should check them out. Fast.ai is a community started by Jeremy Howard and Rachael Thomas in 2016. It now includes an impressive set of courses and a machine learning library by the same name. What sets them apart is their practical no nonsense approach to solving data science problems by example.</description>
